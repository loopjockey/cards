# Overview

This is a card game playable by exactly 2 players. 

A canonical game has 10 coins per player. 

To setup a game take all the 10s out of the deck, shuffle a standard deck (with 2x jokers) and shuffle the 10s. Flip a coin to decide who deals first.

A game can have infinite rounds.

To setup a round deal 5 cards from the deck to each player, then place 3x 10s out horizontally between the two players, the left most one from the dealer should be face-up and the other two face down. These are referred to as lanes.

Each player pays 1 coin each to start a round, this is the beginning of the pot that the winner keeps. 

A round has 5 turns.

In the first turn the player who didn't deal goes starts the turn, otherwise it is whoever played second in the previous turn. Let's call them the initiator.

The initiator can choose to add additional coins to the pot, which their opponent must match to continue playing the round. The opponent can choose to raise again and this can continue until there are no more coins to play.

Once the bid phase is complete, the iniator then plays one card into any of the three lanes face up or face down on their side. The opponent then plays their card on their side in any of the 3 lanes. 

This happens 5 times until there are no more cards to play from both players. Points are tallied, and whoever has the most points in 2/3 lanes wins the round. A draw results in a void match and chips should be equally divided and distributed.

# Points

- Cards played face down are blank, and are worth a flat +3 points
- Cards played face up are worth what their number is, unless...
- Cards played face up that have the same suit as their lane are worth -3 points.
- Face cards are all worth +1 (Ace, Jack, Queen, King and Jokers) {unless matching the lane suit}
- Jack: Flip and then swap one card for another in the current lane (can include the Jack)
- Queen: Flip any card
- King: Move any card to the same lane as the King
- Ace: Flip a lane card (10)
- Joker: Shuffle the 10s and play three out face up.
- 2s count as 10s if in their lane (i.e. 2 of hearts = 10 points if in hearts lane)
- If at any point a player has all 4 7s face up on their side they win the whole game instantly.

Effects of face cards happen when they are played face up, or when they are flipped face up.
